I'll provide a wordy problem definition. Please think through all the bits that could be relevant and any relationships between parts, then give a brief summary of the information actually needed to solve the problem.
The problem usually uses an esoteric input format, write a parse function in python which can read it from a file into a corresponding data structure relevant to the problem using best practices in python. Then write a separate function which operates on that data model to solve the problem. Give all the code as one executable python file that reads input from inputs/00.txt.
